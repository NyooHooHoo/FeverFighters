FeverFighters
ICS4U0 Final Project â€” A video game to teach players how to survive a cold.

Description
Fever Fighters is a simple survival game for children ages 5-6 where the objective is to collect "good" items
for treating a cold while avoiding "bad" ones. The game is run in a JFrame using the Java Swing library, and
all player controls are through mouse clicks for buttons, WASD keys for moving, and the ENTER key for switching
screens.

Running the Program
The executable file `FeverFighters.jar` can be found in the repository. The JAR file must be run with a Java
Development Kit (JDK) version 17+ and the `assets` folder must be in the same directory to be accessed.
Alternatively, the entire program can be run through the driver class `Main.java`.

Documentation
All Javadoc HTML files for documentation of each class can be found in the `documentation` folder of the repository.
